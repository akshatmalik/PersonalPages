## MCIS/SAIL - Queen's University

I am currently working as a research student at the [MSIC](https://mcis.cs.queensu.ca/)/[SAIL Lab](https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/) in [Queen's University, Canada](https://www.queensu.ca/), where I am working under the guidance of [Dr. Bram Adams](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XS9QH_UAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Ahmed Hassan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ&hl=en). SAIL Lab is one of the best software engineering labs in the world, and working with Dr. Adams and Dr. Hassan has been a great learning experience.

During my time at SAIL, I learned about critical thinking regarding any problem statement and working in new and unknown areas. My research area involved providing privacy to software analytics data without compromising the utility of the data and the machine learning models trained on it. This would allow companies to share their data with other companies without compromising the privacy of their systems. To achieve this, we used a novel approach of representing tabular data as a graph and applied graph anonymization techniques to this data representation. Our approach successfully provided privacy to the data with less than a 5% loss in utility. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, we achieved similar privacy scores but with significantly less loss in utility. Based on this work, I wrote two papers and submitted them to EMSE (one under review and one under revision).

## SE4AI - Software Engineering for AI

As a participant in the [NSERC SE4AI CREATE](https://se4ai.org/) program, I delved into the convergence of software engineering and AI. The curriculum spanned AI, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Ethical AI. My learning journey included developing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models, coupled with an understanding of ethical AI development principles.

I worked on a project focused on detecting and quantifying ethical and racial biases in HuggingFace's AI models. We not only pinpointed these biases but also proposed strategies to mitigate them. This initiative was important in enriching my understanding of AI's ethical aspects and guiding me in the responsible creation of AI systems.
