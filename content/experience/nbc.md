## MLOps - National Bank of Canada

I worked as a MLOps Engineer at the National Bank of Canada. I was working on a project which focused on using LLMs in two cases:
- **Chatbot Performance:** Evaluating the performance of chatbots using fine-tuned LLMs.
- **Auto-Annotate Data:** Improved efficiency of manual data annotation using LLMs.
