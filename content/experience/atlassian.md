[//]: # (![Opsgenie Logo]&#40;/img/opsgenie_logo.png&#41;)


At Atlassian since May 2020, I contributed to the Opsgenie team as a key Java developer. Here, I honed my skills in building critical systems powered by AWS, instrumental in serving thousands of users. 


## Technical Achievements üßë‚ÄçüîßÔ∏è

Over the course of 2 years, I worked on a variety of projects, some of which are listed below:


**Technologies Used:** Java - Spring Boot; AWS - RDS, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, ECS; Monitoring - NewRelic, Splunk; Looker

#### Dashboard Optimization ‚è∞Ô∏è


[//]: # (One of the key customer pain points was to optimize the slow load of the dashboards. I was tasked to lead a team of 3 engineers to carry out the efforts to optimize and improve the load time of the dashboards. To carry this out, we had to understand the entire flow of the dashboard load, and identify the bottlenecks, breaking them down into smaller and iterative solutions. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The bottlenecks identified were:)

[//]: # (1. Redundant data being fetched from the database)

[//]: # (2. Unoptimized queries and unindexed tables)

[//]: # (3. Unoptimized code execution)

[//]: # (4. Redundant calls between frontend and backend)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Solving these problems allowed us to **reduce the load time of the dashboards by 98%**, resolving a very important pain point for the customers. We also were able to identify unused resources and **save costs by 70%**. )


Addressing a critical client issue, I led a team of three engineers to optimize dashboard load times‚Äîa major customer pain point. Our analysis pinpointed major bottlenecks: excessive data retrieval from databases, unoptimized SQL queries and table indexing, inefficient code execution, and redundant frontend-backend communications. Our solution not only streamlined the process but also yielded significant results: we achieved a dramatic **98% reduction in dashboard load times**, greatly enhancing user experience. Furthermore, our optimization efforts led to a notable **60% reduction in operational costs** by effectively identifying and eliminating underutilized resources, thereby delivering substantial cost savings alongside performance improvements.

#### Unifying ETL Pipelines üö∞

[//]: # (Another key feature that I worked on was unifying the **ETL pipelines** for our teams. This feature would allow us to remove redundancy in the current system and further help in extending our pipelines to the new analytics platform being developed. I was tasked with the effort to plan and deliver the task with another engineer. Using AWS Lambda, S3, Firehose, and SNS messages, we were able to **remove redundant code maintenance** in the system and **ease the integration of data into the new analytics platform**.)

I played a central role in unifying the ETL pipelines, aiming to enhance system efficiency and align with our developing analytics platform. Tasked with both the planning and execution phases, I collaborated closely with a fellow engineer to design and implement a more streamlined pipeline. Leveraging **AWS Lambda, S3, Firehose, and SNS messaging**, we successfully eliminated redundant code, significantly reducing maintenance overhead. This re-engineering not only optimized our current operations but also facilitated seamless data integration into the new analytics platform, underscoring our commitment to continuous system improvement and scalability.


#### Documentation and Advocacy üìÑ


In my capacity as a key team member, I took the initiative to **document the services** under my ownership. This involved not only creating detailed service documentation but also outlining common tasks, streamlining the onboarding process for new developers and enabling their swift contribution to the project and on-call duties.

As the designated **TechOps Champion**, I instituted a weekly practice of monitoring service health, proactively identifying and addressing recurring issues to ensure system reliability. In my role as the **Security Champion**, I was responsible for swiftly resolving any emerging security challenges, safeguarding our services against vulnerabilities.

Further emphasizing my commitment to operational readiness, I orchestrated **War Games** exercises. These simulations were crucial in preparing the team for potential incidents, enhancing our response capabilities and fortifying our overall service resilience.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (I created extensive documentation for the services I owned, this involved writing documentation and commonly done tasks. I also worked on create alert runbooks for the different issues encountered in production for all services. This allowed new developers to be easily onboarded to the team and contribute to on-call. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (I was also the **TechOps Champion** for the team, where I started the practise of monitoring services health each week to ensure repeated issues did not happen. )

[//]: # (Apart from this, I was the **Security Champion** for the team, which involved resolving any security issues that were found in the services. )

[//]: # (Finally, I also conducted **War Games** for the team to ensure that the team was prepared for any incident that might occur.)

#### Other Projects ‚ûï‚ûï

##### GDPR Compliance

[//]: # (I worked on making **our services GDPR-compliant**, i.e., it was in the region the user wanted the data to be in. This involved creating scripts that would allow reliable and traceable replication and deletion of user data across regions. Using AWS Step funtions we were able to create a reliable and scalable solution to this problem.)

Led the implementation of GDPR compliance across our services, ensuring data localization as per user preferences. Developed AWS Step Functions-based scripts for reliable, traceable data replication and deletion across regions, enhancing data management efficiency and compliance scalability.

##### Service owner and Feature Development

[//]: # (I was a **owner for multiple services** in the team. This involved being the point of contact for the service, and being responsible for the service's uptime and reliability. I was also responsible for the feature development of the service, and the roadmap for the service. I developed some other features and did bug fixes for the service as well. I was both the **day and night on-call** for the team. )

Owned multiple services, overseeing their uptime, reliability, and continuous improvement. Spearheaded feature development, defined service roadmaps, and executed both enhancements and critical bug fixes. Managed on-call responsibilities, ensuring round-the-clock service stability and prompt issue resolution.
