Hello!

I am Akshat Malik.

[//]: # (![Akshat Malik]&#40;/img/akshat.jpg&#41;)


Currently, I am working as a research student at the [SAIL Lab](https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/) in [Queen's University, Canada](https://www.queensu.ca/), where I am working under the guidance of [Dr. Bram Adams](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XS9QH_UAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Ahmed Hassan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Before coming to Canada for my Masters, I was working Bengaluru as Software Developer II in [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and [Soroco](https://soroco.com/). I worked on Java, Python and a bit of C/C++ in college, [R.V. College of Engineering](https://www.rvce.edu.in/). 

I love running, reading books, and I am a board games enthusiast!
